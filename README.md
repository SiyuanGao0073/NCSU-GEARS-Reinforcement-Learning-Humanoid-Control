# Program Overview 

**Duration**: 07/08-07/30

**Instructor**: Professor Hao Su, Ivan Sanchez (postdoc), Junxi Zhu (PhD student)

**Location**: Engineering Building III (for in-person students only)

**Time**: TBD

**Topics**:

* Reinforcement learning basics (including a cart pole code example on Google Colab)
* Humanoid robot simulation project using reinforcement learning

# Tentative Syllabus

# Hardware and Software Requirement

It is strongly recommended that you have a computer with **Linux 18.04** operating system and a **Nvidia GPU** that supports CUDA. They are necessary for the reinforcement learning project.

For in-person students, if you are not able to meet this requirement, you may use the computer we provide in the lab. Two students form a group and share one computer. A total of four computers are available in the lab.

For remote students, you may use the Virtual Computing Lab (VCL) facilities provided by the university. Details TBD.
